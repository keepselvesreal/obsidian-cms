# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasing intervals.

## How It Works
The spacing effect is a cognitive phenomenon where learning is more effective when spread out over time rather than in one session.

## Key Principles
- Review material at strategic intervals
- Increase the interval each time you successfully recall
- Focus on material you find difficult
- Use flashcard systems like Anki

## Benefits
- Better long-term retention
- More efficient study sessions
- Reduces overall study time
- Scientifically proven method
