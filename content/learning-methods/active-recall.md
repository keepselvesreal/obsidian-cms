# Active Recall

Active recall is the process of retrieving information from memory without looking at the original source material.

## Definition
Instead of passively re-reading notes, you actively test yourself to retrieve the information from memory.

## Implementation
### Study Techniques
- Create flashcards and answer without looking
- Close your notes and write what you remember
- Teach the concept to someone else
- Practice problems without referring to examples

## Why It Works
- Forces your brain to retrieve information
- Strengthens memory pathways
- Reveals gaps in understanding
- More effective than passive review

## Comparison with Passive Review
| Passive Review | Active Recall |
|---|---|
| Re-reading notes | Testing yourself |
| Highlighter marking | Writing from memory |
| Low effort | High effort |
| Weak retention | Strong retention |
