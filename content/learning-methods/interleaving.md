# Interleaving

Interleaving is a learning strategy where you mix different topics or problem types during a single study session.

## What is Interleaving?
Instead of blocking practice (doing all problems of one type together), you randomly mix different problem types.

### Example: Math Study
**Blocked Practice (Ineffective)**
- 20 problems of type A
- 20 problems of type B
- 20 problems of type C

**Interleaved Practice (More Effective)**
- Random mix of types A, B, and C throughout the session

## Benefits
- Improved transfer of learning to new problems
- Better discrimination between problem types
- Stronger memory retention
- More realistic real-world application

## When to Use Interleaving
- Problem-solving skills
- Language learning
- Sports training
- Music practice
- Academic subjects

## Challenges
- Feels harder during practice
- Requires self-discipline
- May need careful planning
- Initial performance drops (but learning improves)

## Combination with Other Methods
- [[spaced-repetition]] - Space out interleaved sessions
- [[active-recall]] - Test yourself on mixed topics
- [[test-note-1]] - See general test notes for more
